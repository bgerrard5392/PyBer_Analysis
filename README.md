# PyBer_Analysis


# Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis data analysis for PyBer, a ridesharing company. I am tasked with generating data visualizations that showcase the type of city, number of driers, as well as the percentage of total fares. The goal is to use this data to help PyBer improve access to their ridesharing services and better determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 


# Results and Summary

I was not able to generate visualizations but after cleaning and analyzing the rideshare data from viewpoints it is clear that fares are higher in rural areas because there is less demand than urban cities and suburban settings. That said, urban cities generate the majorirty of revenue due to the higher demand in riders - this is likely to do with cities having a sheer higher and denser population.

Each city type is fairly consistent when it comes to total fares over time with minimal spikes or drops, one recommendation I have for the CEO is to take a closer look into the spikes over a yearly basis. It'd be interesting to know when peaks occur, where they occur, and why.
