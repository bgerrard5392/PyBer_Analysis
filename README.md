# PyBer_Analysis


# Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis data analysis for PyBer, a ridesharing company. I am tasked with generating data visualizations that showcase the type of city, number of driers, as well as the percentage of total fares. The goal is to use this data to help PyBer improve access to their ridesharing services and better determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 


# Results and Summary

Ride Summary Based on the Pyber Rides Summary data it appears to reflect what probably most people would expect. Total Rides: Urban areas have app 3x as many rides as Suburban areas which in turn have app 4x as many rides as rural areas. Total Drivers: Urban areas have many more drivers, likely accounted for having more bus lines or longer daily coverage. Total Fares show expected breakdowns, but not by the same factors as Total Rides. Average per Ride is interesting as it reflects Rural areas generating app $4 more per ride that Suburban which in turn generating app $6 more than Urban. This may be accounted for by longer distances in Rural areas costing more per ride. Average per Driver. This is dominated by the Rural areas at almost 3x the rate of Urban.


# Summary
I was not able to generate visualizations but after cleaning and analyzing the rideshare data from viewpoints it is clear that fares are higher in rural areas because there is less demand than urban cities and suburban settings. That said, urban cities generate the majorirty of revenue due to the higher demand in riders - this is likely to do with cities having a sheer higher and denser population.

Each city type is fairly consistent when it comes to total fares over time with minimal spikes or drops, one recommendation I have for the CEO is to take a closer look into the spikes over a yearly basis. It'd be interesting to know when peaks occur, where they occur, and why.
