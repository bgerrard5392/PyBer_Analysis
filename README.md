# PyBer_Analysis


# Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis data analysis for PyBer, a ridesharing company. I am tasked with generating data visualizations that showcase the type of city, number of driers, as well as the percentage of total fares. The goal is to use this data to help PyBer improve access to their ridesharing services and better determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
